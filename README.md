What are the challenges I experienced in doing Explanatory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression or Machine Learning?
What could have been the reasons why such an event happened?
What are the things we have learned so that we can improve from this experience?
Now what do I need to do better next time?
