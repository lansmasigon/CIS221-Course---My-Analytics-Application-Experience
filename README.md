# 📊 Data Analysis Project Reflection: Challenges and Growth

---

## 🛑 Section 1: Challenges Experienced

### What are the challenges I experienced in doing Explanatory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression or Machine Learning?

# For doing Explanatory Data analysis it was hard to interpret whether trends and correlations were meaningful or just random at first and translating numbers and graphs into clear explanations was challenging.

# For doing inferential regression analysis, understanding the the p-values and significance at first was overwhelming for me.

# For doing Regression or Machine Learning it was overwhelming for me because it was new to me, I wasn’t familiar with the concepts, the algorithms, or even the process of how models are built and evaluated. I had moments where I felt confused and unsure if I was doing things correctly.

## ❓ Section 2: Root Causes

### What could have been the reasons why such an event happened?

# I struggled with the topic because I was absent during some of the discussions for some reasons, so I missed important explanations and examples. Since those lessons introduced key concepts, not being present made it harder for me to follow the next activities.

## ✅ Section 3: Key Learnings

### What are the things we have learned so that we can improve from this experience?

# This experience taught me that it’s okay to ask the teacher or classmates when something is unclear. Asking for clarification can save a lot of time and reduces confusion. I learned how to take responsibility for my learning by checking notes, watching tutorials, and practicing on my own, also I learned that it’s okay to feel confused at first. What matters is that I'm improving and asking for help when needed.

## 🎯 Section 4: Future Action Plan

### Now what do I need to do better next time?

# I need to make sure I stay more updated with the lessons, especially when I miss a class due to reasons. I should review the materials as soon as possible and ask my teacher or classmates for help when something is unclear.
